    "text": "If you have a question not featured here, please send me an email at kpjohns @ uw.edu.\n\nThree questions with the same answer\n\nHow do I join the waitlist for ESM 254?\nHow do I receive an add code for ESM 254?\nWill enrollment increase for this course?\n\nPlease contact academics @ bren.ucsb.edu, let them know your situation, and they will provide you with the most up-to-date information.\n\n\nCan I audit this class?\nHere are a few things I consider when answering this question:\n\nIf there are enough physical open seats in the classroom, then yes. I aim to keep the room at a comfortable and safe capacity.\nDoes a reduced accountability structure match your learning style?\n\nThe format of the course will be a flipped classroom lecture with hands-on active learning assignments during our face-to-face class time. Students who audited with me in this course format have shared that the change in accountability for them makes the in-class discussion and activities challenging. However, everyone learns in different ways, so I cannot make this particular decision for you. I will answer any follow up questions, though!\n\n\nCan I attend this class remotely?\nTLDR; Probably not?\nAt this time (15 February 2023), I am not familiar with the AV equipment available in my assigned classroom for ESM 254. Even if the classroom is equipped with Zoom friendly tech, the format of the in-person components of this course were not designed for a synchronous hybrid modality (See Part 2 of the answer to question above). It has been my experience that students who join via Zoom have a minimal (to none) interactive environment when I try to run a hybrid model at this scale."

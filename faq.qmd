# Three questions with the same answer

- How do I join the waitlist for ESM 254? 
- How do I receive an add code for ESM 254? 
- Will enrollment increase for this course?

Please contact academics @ bren.ucsb.edu, let them know your situation, and they will provide you with the most up-to-date information.

# Can I audit this class?

Here are a few things I consider when answering this question:

1. If there are enough physical open seats in the classroom, then yes. I aim to keep the room at a comfortable and safe capacity.

2. Does a reduced accountability structure match your learning style? 

The format of the course will be a flipped classroom lecture with hands-on active learning assignments during our face-to-face class time. Students who audited with me in this course format have shared that the change in accountability for them makes the in-class discussion and activities challenging. However, everyone learns in different ways, so I cannot make this particular decision for you. I will answer any follow up questions, though!

# Can I attend this class remotely?

TLDR; Probably not?

At this time (15 February 2023), I am not familiar with the AV equipment available in my assigned classroom for ESM 254. Even if the classroom is equipped with Zoom friendly tech, the format of the in-person components of this course were not designed for a synchronous hybrid modality (See Part 2 of the answer to question above). It has been my experience that students who join via Zoom have a minimal (to none) interactive environment when I try to run a hybrid model at this scale.
